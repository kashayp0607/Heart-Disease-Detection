# Heart-Disease-Detection
This repository contains Python code for building and training neural network models to classify heart disease based on a dataset. Two neural network models are implemented: a categorical model for multiclass classification and a binary model for binary classification.

# Model Architecture

# Categorical Model
Input Layer: 13 neurons
Hidden Layers: 8 neurons (ReLU activation), 4 neurons (ReLU activation)
Output Layer: 5 neurons (Softmax activation)
Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy

#Binary Model
Input Layer: 13 neurons
Hidden Layers: 8 neurons (ReLU activation), 4 neurons (ReLU activation)
Output Layer: 1 neuron (Sigmoid activation)
Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy
